Random stuff for NodeCopters

for the traditional way, go wit felixge
https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone


for the cutting edge NoFlo implementation, clone the repo, run nmp install on the root of the cloned project. 

At the Berlin NodeCopter event on 13-10-2013 the concept of the NoFlo copters was developed further. Now all the main movements are in. So, to make your own UI, take look at https://github.com/bergie/flowcopter


Enjoy.
